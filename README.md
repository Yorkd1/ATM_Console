# Overview

This program is a mock up of an ATM Console. This program is similar to what an ATM would normally do for a user with some other features like making a new user account.


The program will first ask the user if they are a member of the bank, or if they would like to create an account for the bank. If the former is indicated it will as for an account number along with a pin to verify if a user is a member of the bank. Once the sign in process is verified and complete the user is free to choose features such as withdrawal, deposit, and check balance. Like mentioned previously, if a user chooses to make a new account then they are asked a series of questions on what they would like to set as their information. An account number is given and they are free to sign in as a user with the account number provided and the pin number they included in their given information. 

The purpose of me writting this program was to practice what I was taught in C# programming and I'm planning to improve this program to demonstrate my understanding of Object Oriented Programming. 

Here is a link to a YouTube video demonstrating how my program works:

# Future Work

Things that I need to fix, improve, and add in the future:

- Security features for pin and account numbers.
- Writing files to store user data seperately so user data will not be lost when program closes.
- Encapsulate member variables.
